Booki is a vacation booking company: the objective of the project is to build a showcase one-page for the platform in responsive design (with media-queries for mobile, tablet and desktop).

The code had to be made of pure HTML5 and CSS3 without any framework (bootstrap, tailwind…) nor preprocessor (sass).
